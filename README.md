###**Emotion Detection using CNN-HMM Model

CS5010 Project
This project is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network - Hidden Markov Model (CNN-HMM) model for emotion detection. The model is trained on a dataset of facial expressions to recognize six basic emotions: happy, sad, angry, surprised, fearful, and disgusted.

The model is deployed to a Flask web application, where users can upload an image containing a human face, and the application will detect the emotion expressed in the image.

Installation
To install and run the application, you will need to follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/emotion_detection.git
Create a virtual environment using Python 3:
python3 -m venv venv

Install all the necessary libraries given in requirments.txt

Activate the virtual environment: source venv/bin/

Run the flask Application :python app.py
