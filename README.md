Emotion Detection using CNN-HMM Model
This project is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network - Hidden Markov Model (CNN-HMM) model for emotion detection. The model is trained on a dataset of facial expressions to recognize six basic emotions: happy, sad, angry, surprised, fearful, and disgusted.

The model is deployed to a Flask web application, where users can upload an image containing a human face, and the application will detect the emotion expressed in the image.

Installation
To install and run the application, you will need to follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/emotion_detection.git
Create a virtual environment using Python 3:
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
